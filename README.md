# firstGoproject
This is my first Golang project

As I started learning not only Go but all the concepts of programming, I decided to test some ideas in a practical, original way.
So I created this little game, inspired by another game called "Perfil" in Brazil.
The idea was to use different concepts such as Structs, Maps, Slices and so on.

Feel free to make changes.
